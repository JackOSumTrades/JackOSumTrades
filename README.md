### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
   - Implementing Finite Element Analysis 
        - Graph and node implementation will be expanded to 2D FEA analysis of cantilever beam (will later be expanded to 3D)
   - Simulating Mechanical Interactions
        - Bouncing Ball implementation will be expanded to include rolling 
   - Simulating Astronomical Interactions
       - Expanding my gravity interaction of simple particles to clusters of particles to simulate asteroid impacts
   - ReactJS Todo App using Firebase (not public on github at the moment :frowning:)
- :exclamation: I'm hoping to work on these soon:  
   - Geopositioning and geomapping of satellite imagery
   - Python implementation of satellite positioning algorithms
   - Hadoop -distributed cluster -based classification of plants (http://image-net.org/explore) 
   - Hadoop -distributed cluster -based bird migration patterns (https://star.cs.ucr.edu/ and https://ebird.org/data/download)
